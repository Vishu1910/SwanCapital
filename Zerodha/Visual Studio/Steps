After we download both the files for .NETforamibroker and the zerodha plugin, we extract them to a specific place.
We run the .NET on a Standard Edition (works for 30 days) when we are setting it up.
Once we are done extracting, we open the project "AmiBrokerPlugInCS1" on VisualBasic2015 and build it.
The build should happen successfully without any errors. Once this is done, we open Amibroker and check for if the Zerodha Plugin is successful.
